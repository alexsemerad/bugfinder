# Bugfinder
You program shall search a text file for bugs and print the number of their occurrence. The bug is drawn ASCII â€“ style and can be found within bug.txt.
For testing purposes we provide a textfile called landscape.txt. The contents of this file is a lot simpler than the file that we will be testing the completed program. Each occurance of the character pattern as specified in bug.txt is counted. Please note that the whitespaces in the pattern file are not part of the pattern. That is the bug shall be recognized on a "noisy" background.
